The MIT License (X11 License)[6] is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)[7] in the late 1980s.[8] As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.[9][10] The Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons projects use the alternative name Expat License.

The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL); MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software, and integrated with other GPL software, but not the other way around.[11] The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software, provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice, or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement. MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software,[12][10] which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses. As of 2020, MIT was the most popular software license found in one analysis,[13] continuing from reports in 2015 that MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub, ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software (FOSS) licenses.[14]

Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System, Ruby on Rails, Nim, Node.js, Lua and jQuery. Notable companies using the MIT License include Microsoft (.NET Core), Google (Angular) and Facebook (React).
